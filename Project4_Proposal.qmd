You should summarize work that already exists (if it does)

You should outline the work you plan to do

You should demonstrate you have access to the data, describe the data, and propose how you will collect the data

You should describe the programming paradigms you plan to use and why it makes sense to combine them for your project

You should describe any packages and/or software you plan to use

You should briefly describe the data analytic product you plan to build

You should describe a tentative timeline for the proposal

## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
1 + 1
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
2 * 2
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (only output is displayed).
